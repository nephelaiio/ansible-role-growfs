An opinionated [ansible role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/nephelaiio/growfs) to grow filesystems for linux systems

## Use case
The main use case for the role is to automatically grow partitions/filesystems on systems installed using [nephelaiio.centos_installer](https://galaxy.ansible.com/nephelaiio/centos_installer) and [nephelaiio.ubuntu_installer](https://galaxy.ansible.com/nephelaiio/ubuntu_installer)

## Logic

The role will implement the following disk management logic when applied to a target system:
For non-lvm disks:
* Expand last partition when containig device has over 5% available unpartitioned space
* Grow mounted partition filesystems when applicable

For lvm with emtpy disks:
* Grow pvs when applicable
* Partition empty disks and assign device to lvm volume group
* Grow target lvm logical volume
* Optionally create and mount a new lvm logical volume

The role will fail when any of the following conditions are found
* A disk device filter (regex) is not defined
* Volume group is not unique
* Logical volume is not unique and an explicit selection has not been made

The role will exit as a no-op in the following cases:
* No LVM is present and a new disk is found

## Role Variables
